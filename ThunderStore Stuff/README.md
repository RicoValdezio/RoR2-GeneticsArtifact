Basic Description
------------
This mod adds a genetics system to the monsters, with every stat being able to mutate in specific ways.
Health, Size, and Move Speed are all directly related, with bigger monsters having more health and moving faster.
Armor and Regen are inversely related, with heavily armored monsters having reduced regen rates.
Damage and Attack Speed are also inversely related, with heavy hitters attacking less often and slower than normal.

How it Works
------------
This is kinda complicated. I plan on adding a video that can give the system a proper explanation, but for right now the main idea is that the longer a monster lives or the more damage it deals to you, the more likely its stats are to be repeated on new monsters.
The actual scoring system for mutations is 1 point per second of being alive, and 1 point for every point of damage it deals. Heavy hitters rack up points faster, but tanks can soak up mor points just for being alive.
Note that the monsters aren't counted towards the genepool until they either die or the stage ends, so if a monster survives the entire stage it won't polute the future genepool.
